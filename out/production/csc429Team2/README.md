******THINGS TO NOTE WHEN COMMITTING*****

1.COMMITS ARE PRETTY MUCH PERMANENT!!!! Replacing a file causes the previous file to be deleted and a hassle to recover it.
  Feel free to make branches if you are unsure about the committing!!
  BRANCHES ARE SAFER.
  Make the names of branches relevant, for merging purposes please!!! So I know what the changes are the branch contains.
  Adding new files is no big deal since there is no deletion of files.

2.Be sure files make it to the right subdirectory.
  ex: userinterface files go into the userinterface folder.
  You can do this by clicking the subdirectory folder you need to add files to and upload the files directly to the subdirectory 
 
3.Test your code before you commit!!!
  DONT ADD BROKEN CODE TO THE REPOSITORY, WHAT'S THE POINT OF THAT????
  Next thing you know the app doesnt even run.

******THINGS TO NOTE WHEN TESTING*****

1. Java code needs to be compiled (you all know that right??). You adding your .java class doesnt actually do anything unless its           compiled. coms.txt contains two cmd commands to compile everything. Simply open cmd (command prompt), change directory to your project directory (ex: cd desktop/csc429project) then paste the two commands into cmd and hit enter. Cmd will report any errors, if so you have some fixing to do. That should compile your changes and now you are free to actually run the application by clicking on the run batch file.

2. Be careful with your ide. They sometimes add extra imports to work with your workspace. For example, eclipse likes to add an import something like import com.sun.stuff.stuff;. You need to remove these before committing or else when compiling there will be errors because it cant find the import.
